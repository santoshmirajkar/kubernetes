# Beyond this course - Setting up a multi-node k8s cluster

We know that for personal experimentation and development, we have some options, such as minikube, microk8s, and kubeadm. Out of these three, kubeadm is the only one which lets you create a multi-node k8s cluster, without any hassle. So it is highly recommended that after this course you setup a kubeadm based k8s cluster of your own. All it needs is just one or two VMs, which you install with the version of Linux OS of your choice, and run few commands to bring it/them up.

To setup a kubeadm based k8s cluster, we recommend using the guide from one of our colleagues: [https://github.com/KamranAzeem/learn-kubernetes/tree/master/kubeadm](https://github.com/KamranAzeem/learn-kubernetes/tree/master/kubeadm) . In this repository you will find guides for **RedHat/CentOS/Fedora** and also **Ubuntu**.
