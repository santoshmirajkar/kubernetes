# Service Discovery and Loadbalancing
In almost every Kubernetes cluster, there is an addon called CoreDNS (previously KubeDNS), which provides service discovery within the cluster, using DNS mechanism. Everytime a *service* is created in kubernetes cluster, it is registered in CoreDNS with the name of the service, it's ClusterIP. e.g. `nginx.default.svc.cluster.local` . There will be more on this later in this document. Each service will have a name, a clusterIP, and also the list of backends linked with this service. This *service* also acts as an internal load balancer, when the service has more than one endpoints. e.g. A nginx delployment can have four replicas. When exposed as a service, the service will have four endpoints. When this service is accessed by a client (a pod or any other process), the service does load balancing between these endpoints. 


## Accessing a service:
To access the actual process/service inside any given pod (e.g. nginx web service), we need to *expose* the related deployment as a kubernetes *service*. We have three main ways of exposing the deployment , or in other words, we have three ways to define a *service*. We can access these three types of services in three different ways. The three types of services are:

* ClusterIP
* NodePort
* LoadBalancer

### Service type: ClusterIP
Expose the deployment as a service - type=ClusterIP:
```
$ kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80 --type ClusterIP
service "nginx" exposed
```

Check the list of services:
```
$ kubectl get services
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
kubernetes   ClusterIP   100.64.0.1       <none>        443/TCP   2d
nginx        ClusterIP   100.70.204.237   <none>        80/TCP    4s
```

Notice, there are two services listed here. The first one is named **kubernetes**, which is the default service created (automatically) when a kubernetes cluster is created for the first time. It does not have any EXTERNAL-IP. This service is not our focus right now.

The service in focus is nginx, which does not have any external IP, nor does it say anything about any other ports except 80/TCP. This means it is not accessible over internet, but we can still access it from within cluster , using the service IP, not the pod IP. Lets see if we can access this service from our multitool.

```
[root@multitool-3148954972-k8q06 /]# curl -s 100.70.204.237 | grep h1
<h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
[root@multitool-3148954972-k8q06 /]# 
```

It worked! 


You can also access the same service using it's DNS name:

```
[root@multitool-3148954972-k8q06 /]# curl -s nginx.default.svc.cluster.local  | grep h1
<h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
[root@multitool-3148954972-k8q06 /]# 
```

You can also use the `describe` command to describe any Kubernetes object in more detail. e.g. we use `describe` to see more details about our nginx service:

```
$ kubectl describe service nginx
Name:              nginx
Namespace:         default
Labels:            app=nginx
Annotations:       <none>
Selector:          app=nginx
Type:              ClusterIP
IP:                100.70.204.237
Port:              <unset>  80/TCP
TargetPort:        80/TCP
Endpoints:         100.96.1.148:80
Session Affinity:  None
Events:            <none>
```

You can of-course use `... describe pod ...` , ` ... describe deployment ...` , etc.


**Additional notes about the Cluster-IP:**
* The IPs assigned to services as Cluster-IP are from a different Kubernetes network called *Service Network*, which is a completely different network altogether. i.e. it is not connected (nor related) to pod-network or the infrastructure network. Technically it is actually not a real network per-se; it is a labelling system, which is used by Kube-proxy on each node to setup correct iptables rules. (This is an advanced topic, and not our focus right now).
* No matter what type of service you choose while *exposing* your deployment, Cluster-IP is always assigned to that particular service.
* Every service has end-points, which point to the actual pods service as a backend of a particular service.
* As soon as a service is created, and is assigned a Cluster-IP, an entry is made in Kubernetes' internal DNS against that service, with this service name and the Cluster-IP. e.g. `nginx.default.svc.cluster.local` would point to `100.70.204.237` . 


### Service type: NodePort

Our nginx service is still not reachable from outside, so now we re-create this service as NodePort.

```
$ kubectl get svc
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
kubernetes   ClusterIP   100.64.0.1       <none>        443/TCP   17h
nginx        ClusterIP   100.70.204.237   <none>        80/TCP    15m
```

```
$ kubectl delete svc nginx
service "nginx" deleted
```

```
$ kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80 --type NodePort
service "nginx" exposed
```

```
$ kubectl get svc
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
kubernetes   ClusterIP   100.64.0.1     <none>        443/TCP        17h
nginx        NodePort    100.65.29.172  <none>        80:32593/TCP   8s
```

Notice that we still don't have an external IP, but we now have an extra port `32593` for this pod. This port is a **NodePort** exposed on the worker nodes. So now, if we know the IP of our nodes, we can access this nginx service from the internet. First, we find the public IP of the nodes:
```
$ kubectl get nodes -o wide
NAME                                            STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION        EXTERNAL-IP     OS-IMAGE                             KERNEL-VERSION   CONTAINER-RUNTIME
gke-dcn-cluster-35-default-pool-dacbcf6d-3918   Ready     <none>    17h       v1.8.8-gke.0   35.205.22.139   Container-Optimized OS from Google   4.4.111+         docker://17.3.2
gke-dcn-cluster-35-default-pool-dacbcf6d-c87z   Ready     <none>    17h       v1.8.8-gke.0   35.187.90.36    Container-Optimized OS from Google   4.4.111+         docker://17.3.2
```

Even though we have only one pod (and two worker nodes), we can access any of the node with this port, and it will eventually be routed to our pod. So, lets try to access it from our local work computer:

```
$ curl -s 35.205.22.139:32593 | grep h1
<h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
```

It works!

### Service type: LoadBalancer
So far so good; but, we do not expect the users to know the IP addresses of our worker nodes. It is not a flexible way of doing things. So we re-create the service as `type=LoadBalancer`. The type LoadBalancer is only available for use, if your k8s cluster is setup in any of the public cloud providers, GCE, AWS, etc.

```
[demo@kworkhorse exercises]$ kubectl delete svc nginx
service "nginx" deleted
```

```
$ kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80 --type LoadBalancer
service "nginx" exposed
```

```
$ kubectl get svc
NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
kubernetes   ClusterIP      100.64.0.1     <none>        443/TCP        17h
nginx        LoadBalancer   100.69.15.89   <pending>     80:31354/TCP   5s
```

In few minutes of time the external IP will have some value instead of the word 'pending' . 
```
$ kubectl get svc
NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
kubernetes   ClusterIP      100.64.0.1     <none>        443/TCP        17h
nginx        LoadBalancer   100.69.15.89   35.205.60.29  80:31354/TCP   5s

```

Now, we can access this service without using any special port numbers:
```
[demo@kworkhorse exercises]$ curl -s 35.205.60.29 | grep h1
<h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
[demo@kworkhorse exercises]$
```

**Additional notes about LoadBalancer:**
* A service defined as LoadBalancer will still have some high-range port number assigned to it's main service port, just like NodePort. This has a clever purpose, but is an advance topic and is not our focus at this point.


## High Availability / Load balancing

To prove that multiple pods of the same deployment provide high availability, we do a small exercise. To visualize it, we need to run a small web server which could return us some uniqe content when we access it. We will use our trusted multitool for it. Lets run it as a separate deployment and access it from our local computer.

```shell
$ kubectl create deployment customnginx --image=praqma/network-multitool
deployment.apps/customnginx created
$ kubectl scale deployment customnginx --replicas=4
deployment.extensions/customnginx scaled
```

```shell
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                           READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
customnginx-3557040084-1z489   1/1       Running   0          49s
customnginx-3557040084-3hhlt   1/1       Running   0          49s
customnginx-3557040084-c6skw   1/1       Running   0          49s
customnginx-3557040084-fw1t3   1/1       Running   0          49s
multitool-5f9bdcb789-k7f4q     1/1       Running   0          19m
```

Lets create a service for this deployment as a type=LoadBalancer:

```shell
$ kubectl expose deployment customnginx --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer
service/customnginx exposed
```

Verify the service and note the public IP address:

```shell
$ kubectl get services
NAME          TYPE           CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP        PORT(S)        AGE
customnginx   LoadBalancer   100.67.40.4   35.205.60.41       80:30087/TCP   1m
kubernetes    ClusterIP      100.64.0.1    <none>             443/TCP        17h
```

Query the service, so we know it works as expected:

```shell
$ curl -s 35.205.60.41 | grep IP
Container IP: 100.96.1.150 <BR></p>
```

Next, setup a small bash loop on your local computer to curl this IP address, and get it's IP address.

```shell
$ while true; do sleep 1; curl -s 35.205.60.41; done
Praqma Network MultiTool (with NGINX) - customnginx-7fcfd947cf-zbvtd - 100.96.2.36 <BR></p>
Praqma Network MultiTool (with NGINX) - customnginx-7fcfd947cf-zbvtd - 100.96.1.150 <BR></p>
Praqma Network MultiTool (with NGINX) - customnginx-7fcfd947cf-zbvtd - 100.96.2.37 <BR></p>
Praqma Network MultiTool (with NGINX) - customnginx-7fcfd947cf-zbvtd - 100.96.2.37 <BR></p>
Praqma Network MultiTool (with NGINX) - customnginx-7fcfd947cf-zbvtd - 100.96.2.36 <BR></p>
^C
```

We see that when we query the LoadBalancer IP, it is giving us result/content from all four containers. None of the curl commands is timed out. Now, if we kill three out of four pods, the service should still respond, without timing out. We let the loop run in a separate terminal, and kill three pods of this deployment from another terminal.

```shell
$ kubectl delete pod customnginx-3557040084-1z489 customnginx-3557040084-3hhlt customnginx-3557040084-c6skw
pod "customnginx-3557040084-1z489" deleted
pod "customnginx-3557040084-3hhlt" deleted
pod "customnginx-3557040084-c6skw" deleted
```

Immediately check the other terminal for any failed curl commands or timeouts.

```shell
Container IP: 100.96.1.150 <BR></p>
Container IP: 100.96.1.150 <BR></p>
Container IP: 100.96.2.37 <BR></p>
Container IP: 100.96.1.149 <BR></p>
Container IP: 100.96.1.149 <BR></p>
Container IP: 100.96.1.150 <BR></p>
Container IP: 100.96.2.36 <BR></p>
Container IP: 100.96.2.37 <BR></p>
Container IP: 100.96.2.37 <BR></p>
Container IP: 100.96.2.38 <BR></p>
Container IP: 100.96.2.38 <BR></p>
Container IP: 100.96.2.38 <BR></p>
Container IP: 100.96.1.151 <BR></p>
```

We notice that no curl command failed, and actually we have started seeing new IPs. Why is that? It is because, as soon as the pods are deleted, the deployment sees that it's desired state is four pods, and there is only one running, so it immediately starts three more to reach that desired state. And, while the pods are in process of starting, one surviving pod takes the traffic.

```shell
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                           READY     STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
customnginx-3557040084-0s7l8   1/1       Running       0          15s
customnginx-3557040084-1z489   1/1       Terminating   0          16m
customnginx-3557040084-3hhlt   1/1       Terminating   0          16m
customnginx-3557040084-bvtnh   1/1       Running       0          15s
customnginx-3557040084-c6skw   1/1       Terminating   0          16m
customnginx-3557040084-fw1t3   1/1       Running       0          16m
customnginx-3557040084-xqk1n   1/1       Running       0          15s
```

This proves, Kubernets provides us High Availability, using multiple replicas of a pod.

## Clean up

Delete deployments and services as follow:

```shell
$ kubectl delete deployment customnginx
$ kubectl delete deployment multitool
$ kubectl delete service customnginx
```
